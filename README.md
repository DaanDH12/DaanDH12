 Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey<br>
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey<br>
I'd heard about you before<br>
I wanted to know some more<br>
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine<br>
Oh, you make me dizzy<br>
Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey<br>
Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey<br>
The way that you kiss good night<br>
The way that you hold me tight<br>
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing<br>
I don't wanna hurt you baby, I don't wanna see you cry<br>
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high<br>
But I'm gonna stick to you boy, you'll never get rid of me<br>
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be<br>
Honey honey, touch me baby, a-ha, honey honey<br>
Honey honey, hold me baby, a-ha, honey honey<br>
You look like a movie star (look like a movie star)<br>
But I know just who you are (I wonder just who you are)<br>
And honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast<br>
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high<br>
  <br>
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be<br>
Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey<br>
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey<br>
I'd heard about you before (I'd heard about you before)<br>
I wanted to know some more (I wanted to know you some more)<br>
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine Oh, you make me dizzy<br>
